Viterbi Algorithm is the main algorithm for Most Likely Explanation (MLE) in HMM.  We study the hypothesis that the prediction accuracy of Viterbi algorithm can be estimated a prior by computing the arithmetic mean of the cosines of the emission probabilities.  Our analysis and experimental results suggest a close relationship between these two quantities.
